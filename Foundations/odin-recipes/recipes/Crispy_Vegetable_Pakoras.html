      <h1>Crispy Vegetable Pakoras</h1>
      <p>
        These are very yummy, and if any of you have ever had Japanese tempura
        coated veggies, you'll love this recipe. It's similar, yet it is unique
        in it's taste. Serve with a chili sauce, mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and
        sour sauce. Try other vegetables for dipping, such as sweet potatoes,
        broccoli and asparagus.
